Discrepancy(differing accounts) is different to contradiction(if A then B is false)

“Contradictory” Reports of Jesus
Doesn’t disprove event happened, makes sense that different people have different perspectives- point for authenticity

There are 130,000 words in the New Testament but there are more than 400,000 variant readings-so why should it be believed to be non-corrupt?
 Yes there’s a lot of variants, that’s what’s expected. But the existence of thousands of copies of the Greek New Testament is what allows us to reconstruct the original, despite of the variants. 

In many instances in the bible, if someone calls attention to someone being "greater" it usually means of a higher authority/position as opposed to nature
