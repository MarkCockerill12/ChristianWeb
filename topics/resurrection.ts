The resurrection is the central point of Christianity, after all "...if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile..." (1 Corinthians 15:17). Being able to prove that Jesus indeed rose from the dead would give credibility to all his other miracles and claims too. So if it is possible to prove it, it would be one of the most important points ever. So let's look at the evidence for it.

Most New Testament scholars, including skeptics, accept these basic facts:

**1. Jesus Died by Crucifixion**
- **Multiple Sources**: All four Gospels, Paul, Josephus, Tacitus
- **Enemy Attestation**: Even opponents didn't deny the crucifixion
- **Medical Evidence**: Crucifixion was well-documented Roman practice
- **Medical Account**: The entire ordeal of Jesus' death is well documented and detailed

**2. Jesus Was Buried**
- **Buried by Joseph of Arimathea**: Unlikely invention (member of Sanhedrin)
- **Confirmed Location**: Tomb known to early Christians

**3. The Tomb Was Found Empty**
- **Early Sources**: Mentioned in early creeds (1 Cor 15:3-7)
- **Multiple Sources**: Implied by all resurrection accounts
- **Jerusalem Setting**: Could be easily verified or refuted
- **Women as Witnesses as the first witnesses**: Culturally men held higher authority and credibility

**4. The Disciples Believed They Saw (and interacted with) Risen Jesus**
- **Multiple Witnesses**: Over 500 people claimed to see Jesus (1 Cor 15:6)
- **Variety of Circumstances**: Different times, places, and group sizes
- **Physical Interactions**: Disciples touched Jesus (John 20:27)

**5. The Disciples Were Transformed**
- **Transformed Lives**: Disciples went from hiding to being able to speak multiple languages and went out into the eastern world to preach
- **Willingness to Die**: Many died for their claims, which is impossible for a human to do if they do not truly believe in their cause.
- **Rapid Church Growth**: Christianity spread rapidly despite persecution from the roman emmpire


These facts all come together to form a very strong case


Because it is a historically documented fact, there have been many alternative theories that try to explain the resurrection without God.

**The Swoon Theory**
**Claim**: Jesus didn't actually die but just fainted
**Problems**: 
- Roman executioners were experts
- Spear thrust to the heart (John 19:34)
- Medical impossibility after crucifixion
- He was buried in a tomb with a large stone
- He was left in said tomb for 3 days without food or water

**The Hallucination Theory**
**Claim**: Disciples hallucinated the appearances, this is given more credibility because lead pipes were used in Jerusalem, leading to possible poisoning
**Problems**:
- Group hallucinations on that scale with such consistency are impossible
- The hallucinations happened consistently over 40 days
- Doesn't explain the empty tomb
- Hallucinations don't typically transform worldviews of entire groups
- The disciples were in complete despair because they believed Jesus was truly dead, they had no hope he would return. Jesus' brother, James also denied his divinity and thought he was out of his mind, but upon seeing him, converted.
- Thomas didn't believe the disciples until he was able to see and physically touch Jesus with his own hands.
- Paul would also need to have hallucinated years later.

**The Conspiracy Theory**
**Claim**: Disciples stole the body and lied
**Problems**:
- Disciples died for their claims that Jesus rose from the dead (psychologically impossible if lying)
- The tomb was guarded by Roman soldiers and sealed with a huge stone
- Doesn't explain how people physically saw Jesus
- Doesn't explain Paul's conversion

**The Wrong Tomb Theory**
**Claim**: Women went to the wrong tomb
**Problems**:
- Seems highly unlikely given the prominence of the burial and the importance of the tomb itself
- Joseph of Arimathea would have corrected this
- Doesn't explain the appearances

**The Alien Theory**
**Claim**: Aliens took Jesus' body
**Problems**:
- No



The resurrection belief was immediate, not a later development:
- **1 Corinthians 15:3-7**: Creed dating to within 2-5 years
- **Early Sermons in Acts**: Resurrection central from the beginning
- **Paul's Letters**: Written 20-30 years after, assume resurrection belief



Even renowned atheist historians accept that Jesus was seen after his death. And many who sought to disprove christianity had their minds changed by this fact. 

**Gerd Lüdemann**- “It may be taken as historically certain that Peter and the Disciples had experiences after Jesus’ death in which Jesus appeared to them as the risen Christ”.

**Bert Ehrman**- “We can say with complete certainty that some disciples at some later time insisted that… he soon appeared to the, convincing them that he had been raised from the dead.” “It is historical fact that some of Jesus’ followers came to believe that he had been raised from the dead soon after his execution.”

**Paula Fredriksen**- “I know in their own terms what they saw was the raised Jesus… I’m not saying that they really did see the raised Jesus. I wasn’t there. But I do know… as a historian they must have seen something.”



The historical evidence strongly supports the reality of Jesus' resurrection, making it the most reasonable explanation for the known facts.
