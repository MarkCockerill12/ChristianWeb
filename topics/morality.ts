If there is no God, is rape truly wrong? Or is it just another survival mechanism in an indifferent universe? This isn't a comfortable question, but it's one we must honestly confront when examining the foundation of morality.

The Problem Without God

In a purely naturalistic worldview, we face some uncomfortable realities<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a><a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-indispensability-of-theological-meta-ethical-foundations-for-morality/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a>:

**If evolution is true and survival of the fittest is the driving force**, then traits like aggression, deception, and even violence might be "naturally selected" advantages<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[3]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a>. Why would rape be morally wrong if it increases reproductive success? Why would lying be wrong if it helps you survive?

**If we're just chemical reactions in a meaningless universe**, then our moral intuitions are merely evolutionary accidents<a href="https://www.darwinianmedicine.com/evolution-and-ethics/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[5]</a><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11406-018-9929-y" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a>. The feeling that murder is wrong would be no more objectively true than the feeling that chocolate tastes good.

The Nihilistic Conclusion

Without God, we arrive at nihilism - the view that nothing has ultimate meaning or value<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nihilism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a><a href="https://www.nietzschesource.org/eKGWB/BKV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[8]</a>. Friedrich Nietzsche understood this when he declared "God is dead" - he knew this meant the death of objective morality too. As he wrote: "What I relate is the history of the next two centuries... this whole tremendous event is still on its way"<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[9]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[10]</a>.

If there's no God:
- There's no ultimate purpose to existence
- Pain and suffering are just unfortunate accidents
- Love is merely a chemical reaction
- Justice is an arbitrary human construct
- Hitler and Mother Teresa are ultimately equal in cosmic significance

Comprehensive Analysis of Secular Moral Philosophies

Many philosophers have attempted to establish objective morality without God, but each fails under scrutiny<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/relativi/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[12]</a>:

1. Utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill, Singer)
**The Theory**: *"The greatest good for the greatest number"* - Actions are right if they maximize overall happiness or well-being<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[13]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[14]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Measurement Problem**: How do you quantify and compare different types of happiness? Is the pleasure of reading poetry equal to physical pleasure?<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/philosophy" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[45]</a>
- **The Minority Problem**: If torturing one innocent person would make millions slightly happier, utilitarianism demands it<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[46]</a>
- **The Foundation Problem**: Who decides what "good" means? Why should we care about the majority's happiness rather than our own?

2. Social Contract Theory (Hobbes, Locke, Rawls)
**The Theory**: *"Morality comes from agreements we make"* - Right and wrong are determined by what rational people would agree to in forming society<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[15]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[16]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **Cultural Relativism**: This makes morality completely relative to society. Slavery was once legally and socially accepted - does that make it moral?<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[47]</a>
- **The Outsider Problem**: What about those who can't participate in the contract (children, mentally disabled, animals)?<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[48]</a>
- **The Power Problem**: Those with more power get a better "deal" - might makes right

3. Evolutionary Ethics (Darwin, Wilson, de Waal)
**The Theory**: *"Morality evolved to help us survive"* - Cooperative behaviors were naturally selected because they helped our ancestors survive<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/bio-ethic/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[17]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/ev-debunk/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[18]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Is-Ought Problem**: Even if cooperation helped us survive, why does that make it morally right? Rape and violence also helped some survive<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/evolution-ethics" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[49]</a>
- **The Group Selection Problem**: Evolution primarily selects for individual benefit, not group benefit. Selfishness should be more "natural"<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sociobiology/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[50]</a>
- **The Debunking Problem**: If our moral beliefs are just evolutionary accidents, we have no reason to trust them as true

4. Kantian Deontological Ethics
**The Theory**: *"Act only according to maxims you'd want universalized"* - The Categorical Imperative provides objective moral duties independent of consequences<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[19]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[20]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **Kant's Own Admission**: Kant himself acknowledged that without God and immortality, his moral system collapses. He needed the "postulates of practical reason"<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/kantview/#H3" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[51]</a>
- **The Motivation Problem**: Why should we care about universalizability? Where does this obligation come from?
- **The Conflict Problem**: Categorical duties can conflict (truth-telling vs. protecting innocent life)

5. Virtue Ethics (Aristotle, MacIntyre)
**The Theory**: *"Be virtuous"* - Focus on character traits rather than acts or consequences. Develop virtues like courage, honesty, and justice<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[52]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[53]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Definition Problem**: Who decides what virtues are? Different cultures value different traits
- **The Guidance Problem**: Virtue ethics gives little specific guidance. "Be courageous" doesn't tell us what to do in specific situations<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/virtue/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[54]</a>
- **The Foundation Problem**: Without a teleological view of human nature (which requires God), virtues are arbitrary

6. Emotivism (Ayer, Stevenson)
**The Theory**: *"Moral statements are just expressions of emotion"* - "Murder is wrong" just means "Boo murder!" There are no moral facts<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/moral-co/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[55]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/emotiv/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[56]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Disagreement Problem**: If morality is just emotion, moral disagreement is meaningless
- **The Progress Problem**: We can't say moral progress has occurred (ending slavery, women's rights)
- **The Self-Refutation Problem**: The theory itself claims to be objectively true about morality

7. Moral Relativism (Benedict, Harman)
**The Theory**: *"Morality is relative to culture"* - There are no universal moral truths, only cultural preferences<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/moral-re/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[57]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[58]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Tolerance Paradox**: If tolerance is just a Western value, why should intolerant cultures adopt it?
- **The Reform Problem**: Moral reformers like Martin Luther King Jr. would be wrong by definition
- **The Self-Refutation Problem**: The claim "all morality is relative" is itself an absolute moral claim

8. Existentialist Ethics (Sartre, Camus)
**The Theory**: *"We create our own values"* - In an absurd, meaningless universe, we must create meaning and values through authentic choice<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[59]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/sartre/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[60]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Arbitrariness Problem**: If we create our own values, Hitler's values are as valid as Mother Teresa's
- **The Inconsistency Problem**: Existentialists still seem to prefer some values (authenticity, freedom) over others
- **The Nihilism Problem**: If life is truly absurd, why not just give up entirely?

9. Objectivism (Ayn Rand)
**The Theory**: *"Rational egoism is moral"* - Each person should pursue their own rational self-interest<a href="https://www.aynrand.org/novels/the-fountainhead" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[61]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/rand/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[62]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Parasitism Problem**: Why help anyone who can't benefit you? Children, elderly, disabled become burdens
- **The Cooperation Problem**: Many situations require sacrifice for the common good
- **The Definition Problem**: What counts as "rational" self-interest? Who decides?

10. Moral Naturalism (Foot, Thomson)
**The Theory**: *"Moral facts are natural facts"* - Morality can be grounded in human nature and flourishing<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[63]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/mor-nat/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[64]</a>.

**Fatal Problems**:
- **The Open Question Argument**: We can always ask "But is human flourishing good?" showing it's not self-evidently moral<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moore/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[65]</a>
- **The Naturalistic Fallacy**: Deriving "ought" from "is" without justification
- **The Species Problem**: Why privilege human flourishing over other species?

The Universal Moral Intuition

Here's what's fascinating: **Even atheists act as if objective morality exists**<a href="https://www.apologetics315.com/2018/08/the-problem-of-evil-for-atheists.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[21]</a><a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/scholarly-writings/the-axiological-argument/god-and-objective-moral-values/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[22]</a>. 

They get outraged at injustice. They fight for human rights. They condemn genocide. But if their worldview were true, these would just be personal preferences with no more objective validity than preferring vanilla over chocolate.

**C.S. Lewis** observed this perfectly: *"A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line"*<a href="https://www.cslewis.com/us/books/mere-christianity/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[23]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/lewiscs/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[24]</a>. Our ability to recognize moral evil implies an objective standard of good.

The Moral Argument for God's Existence

Premise 1: If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist
Premise 2: Objective moral values and duties do exist
Conclusion: Therefore, God exists

This argument, defended by philosophers like **William Lane Craig** and **Robert Adams**, is logically valid<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/scholarly-writings/the-axiological-argument/the-indispensability-of-theological-meta-ethical-foundations-for-morality/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[66]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/divine-command/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[67]</a>. The only question is whether the premises are true.

**Evidence for Premise 2**:
- Our deepest moral intuitions (genocide is wrong, love is good, justice matters)
- Moral progress is real (ending slavery, expanding rights)
- Moral reformers appeal to standards beyond their culture
- Even relativists act as if some things are really wrong

The Euthyphro Dilemma (And Its Resolution)

**The Challenge**: "Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good?"<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[68]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/divine-c/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[69]</a>

**The False Dilemma**: This assumes goodness is either arbitrary (first horn) or independent of God (second horn).

**The Christian Solution**: Goodness is grounded in God's **nature**, not His arbitrary commands or some external standard. God is essentially loving, just, merciful, and holy. His commands flow from His unchanging character<a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/god-is-love" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[70]</a><a href="https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/holiness-god" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[71]</a>.

The Image of God

The Bible provides the missing foundation: *"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them"* (Genesis 1:27)<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[25]</a><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[26]</a>.

This explains several profound realities:

**Why morality feels universal**: *"Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law... they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts"* (Romans 2:14-15)<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A14-15&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[27]</a><a href="https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/45-15/the-law-of-god-written-on-the-heart" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[28]</a>

**Why we have dignity**: Humans aren't just evolved animals - we bear God's image, giving us inherent worth and value<a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-that-man-is-made-in-the-image-of-god" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[29]</a><a href="https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/what-does-it-mean-be-made-image-god" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[30]</a>

**Why we long for justice**: God is perfectly just, and we reflect that characteristic<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/God-of-justice.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[31]</a><a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/october/why-we-long-for-justice.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[32]</a>

The Foundation of Meaning

God doesn't just provide the foundation for morality - He provides the foundation for **meaning** itself<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-absurdity-of-life-without-god/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[33]</a><a href="https://www.apologetics315.com/2014/06/the-problem-of-meaning-and-value.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[34]</a>.

**Without God**: Life is ultimately meaningless, a brief flicker in an indifferent cosmos heading toward heat death.

**With God**: Life has eternal significance. Our choices matter. Love, sacrifice, and justice aren't illusions - they reflect the very nature of ultimate reality.

As Dostoevsky wrote: *"If God does not exist, everything is permitted"*<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dostoevsky/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[35]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/dostoevs/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[36]</a>

The Remarkable Consistency Across Cultures

What's remarkable is how the Golden Rule appears across cultures: *"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"* (Matthew 7:12)<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A12&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[37]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/goldrule/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[38]</a>:

- **Buddhism**: "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful"
- **Hinduism**: "This is the sum of duty: do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you"
- **Islam**: "None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself"
- **Judaism**: "What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor"
- **Confucianism**: "Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself"

This universal moral insight points to a common source - a moral lawgiver who created all humanity in His image<a href="https://www.discovery.org/a/universal-moral-law/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[39]</a><a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/scholarly-writings/the-axiological-argument/moral-argument/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[40]</a>.

Modern Challenges and Responses

The Challenge of Moral Disagreement
**Objection**: "If morality is objective, why do people disagree so much?"

**Response**: 
- People disagree about mathematics too, but that doesn't make math subjective
- Much "moral disagreement" is actually about facts, not values (e.g., when life begins)
- Core moral principles (love, justice, fairness) are remarkably universal
- Disagreement often comes from applying agreed principles to complex situations<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[72]</a>

The Challenge of Evolution
**Objection**: "Evolution explains morality - we don't need God"

**Response**:
- Evolution might explain why we have moral *feelings*, but not whether they track moral *truth*
- If our moral beliefs are just evolutionary programming, we have no reason to trust them
- Evolution primarily selects for survival, not truth or morality
- Many evolutionary "imperatives" (aggression, tribalism, selfishness) conflict with morality<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-evolutionary/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[73]</a>

The Challenge of Suffering
**Objection**: "If God is good, why is there so much evil and suffering?"

**Response**:
- This actually presupposes objective moral standards (that suffering is bad)
- Without God, suffering isn't objectively bad - it's just unfortunate
- The existence of evil points to a standard of good, not the absence of God
- Free will necessarily allows for moral evil; natural disasters allow for courage, compassion, and growth<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-problem-of-evil/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[74]</a>

The Ultimate Answer

The deepest question isn't whether God exists, but whether **life has meaning**. And if God exists - if we're created in His image for relationship with Him - then:

- Our moral intuitions make sense
- Human dignity is grounded in reality  
- Justice isn't just a human construct
- Love has ultimate significance
- Your life has eternal meaning
- Moral progress is real and valuable
- Sacrifice for others reflects divine love

*"He has also set eternity in the human heart"* (Ecclesiastes 3:11)<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A11&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[41]</a><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/he-has-put-eternity-into-mans-heart" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[42]</a>

The reason we can't escape moral obligations - even when we deny God - is because we're made in His image. The moral law isn't imposed from outside; it's written on our hearts by our Creator who **is** love itself (1 John 4:8)<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[43]</a><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/God-is-love.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[44]</a>.

In the end, the question isn't whether you can be good without God - many atheists live admirable lives. The question is whether "good" means anything real without God. Without a divine foundation, morality becomes nothing more than personal preference dressed up in fancy language. But our deepest intuitions rebel against this conclusion - because we're made for something more.
