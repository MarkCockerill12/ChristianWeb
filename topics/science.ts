    <h3>Christianity and Science: Partners, Not Enemies</h3>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Christianity and science are not in conflict. In fact, the Christian worldview provided the foundational assumptions that made modern science possible. Many of history's greatest scientists were devout Christians, and Christianity continues to support scientific inquiry today.</p>
    
    <h4>Historical Foundation: Christianity Birthed Modern Science</h4>
    
    <p><strong>The Christian Worldview Made Science Possible:</strong> Several Christian beliefs were essential for science<a href="https://www.breakpoint.org/faith-reason-and-scientific-revolution/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Rational God:</strong> A logical God created an orderly, comprehensible universe</p>
    <p>• <strong>Human reason:</strong> Made in God's image, humans can understand creation</p>
    <p>• <strong>Natural laws:</strong> God governs creation through consistent, discoverable laws</p>
    <p>• <strong>Empirical investigation:</strong> Studying creation honors God and benefits humanity</p>
    
    <p><strong>Medieval Christian Foundations:</strong> The groundwork was laid in Christian institutions<a href="https://christianitytoday.com/history/2008/august/how-christianity-created-science.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a></p>

    <h4>Biblical Foundation for Scientific Inquiry</h4>
    
    <p><strong>God's Creation Declares His Glory:</strong> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+19%3A1-2&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Psalm 19:1-2</a>)</p>
    
    <p><strong>God's Invisible Qualities Revealed in Creation:</strong> "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A20&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Romans 1:20</a>)</p>
    
    <p><strong>Christ as Creator:</strong> "For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A16-17&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Colossians 1:16-17</a>)</p>
    
    <p><strong>Faith and Understanding of Creation:</strong> "By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A3&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Hebrews 11:3</a>)</p>
    
    <p><strong>God's Wisdom in Creation:</strong> "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+25%3A2&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Proverbs 25:2</a>)</p>
    
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Rather than being enemies, Christianity and science are natural allies. The Christian worldview provided the foundation for modern science, Christian scientists made most major discoveries, and Christian values continue to guide ethical scientific practice. True conflict exists not between Christianity and science, but between naturalistic philosophy and theistic belief<a href="https://reasons.org/explore/blogs/todays-new-reason-to-believe/read/todays-new-reason-to-believe/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[16]</a>.</p>
