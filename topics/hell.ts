Hell is often portrayed as a place of fire and brimstone. Where everyone who doesn't believe is tortured for the rest of eternity. But is this true? And how accurate is it really?


First off all, we need to actually see what the bible says about hell<a href="https://www.christiananswers.net" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a><a href="https://carm.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a>. 
The word "hell" appears 54 times in the Bible, referring to various concepts and locations related to punishment and the afterlife<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[3]</a><a href="https://biblehub.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[15]</a>. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word "Sheol" is often translated as "hell," but can also mean "grave" or "pit"<a href="https://www.ancient-hebrew.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[16]</a><a href="https://www.sefaria.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[18]</a>. In the New Testament, the Greek words "Hades," "Gehenna," and "Tartarus" are also translated as "hell," with each having its own specific meaning<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[17]</a><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[19]</a>. 
Since there are so many instances of the word, let's go to the most authorative source, Jesus<a href="https://netbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a><a href="https://www.esv.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[12]</a>.

1. He referred to it as a place of "outer darkness" where "there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 8:12)<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[13]</a><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[14]</a>
2. Jesus also refers to hell as a "fiery furnace" where law-breakers will be thrown at the end of the age when he returns. "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 13:41–42)<a href="https://netbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a><a href="https://www.dts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a>. 
3. "the hell of fire" (Matt. 5:22)<a href="https://www.esv.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[12]</a><a href="https://biblehub.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[15]</a>
4. "eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matt. 25:41)<a href="https://www.apologeticspress.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a><a href="https://www.ligonier.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[25]</a>
5. "the fire never goes out" (Mark 9:43)<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[13]</a><a href="https://www.gty.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[32]</a>
6. "eternal punishment" (Matt. 25:46)<a href="https://www.wts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[26]</a>


But this seems to reaffirm the normal idea of hell as a place purely of fire and torture. So is that it?

Not quite, while Jesus does talk about the fire in hell, this is in regards to the punishment of the devil and his angels as well as being one of the many descriptions we are given<a href="https://carm.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a><a href="https://www.sbts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[8]</a>. We know
that God delivers pure justice, so it would be safe to say that a random person wouldn't suffer in the same way hitler would in hell<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[39]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[33]</a>.

If we look into more verses, it becomes clear that hell isn't bad purely because of any fire and torture, but mainly because it's completely seperate from God<a href="https://www.christiananswers.net" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a><a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[24]</a>.
In essence, hell is the absence of God<a href="https://www.ligonier.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[25]</a><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[26]</a>. 

When we walk our path in life, we either choose to walk with God or without him. We have the free will to choose as we please<a href="https://www.catholic.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[41]</a><a href="https://www.newadvent.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[21]</a>. 
And because God loves us, he will respect our choice, continuing it in the afterlife<a href="https://www.crossway.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[27]</a><a href="https://www.str.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[40]</a>. 

But what about going to hell because of sin? Isn't hell the ultimate punishment for sin?

Yes, because sin is everything that is not of God. God is everything that is good and loving. Sin is the opposite<a href="https://www.dts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a><a href="https://www.wts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a>.

The greatetst news is that us going to heaven doesn't depend on us being good, or perfect or anything like that<a href="https://billygraham.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[37]</a><a href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[38]</a>. As Jesus said 
"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16)<a href="https://netbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a><a href="https://www.esv.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[12]</a> all we need to do in 
order to be saved is to believe in him and accept Jesus into our hearts<a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[28]</a><a href="https://www.apologeticspress.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a>. And when we do that, we are forgiven of anything that has seperates us from God<a href="https://www.gty.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[32]</a><a href="https://www.monergism.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[29]</a>.
