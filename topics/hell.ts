Hell is often portrayed as a place of fire and brimstone, where unbelievers are tortured for eternity. We must turn to the Bible to understand what it actually teaches<a href="https://christiananswers.net/q-grace/hell-and-god.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a><a href="https://apologeticspress.org/the-eternality-of-hell-part-i-1474/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a>. 

The word "hell" appears around 54 times in the Bible, referring to various concepts related to punishment and the afterlife<a href="https://tentmaker.org/articles/Hell_is_Leaving_the_Bible_Forever.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[3]</a><a href="https://www.gordonconwell.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a>. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word Sheol is often translated as "hell," but it primarily signifies the grave or the place of the dead<a href="https://www.ancient-hebrew.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[5]</a><a href="https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/135611" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a>.

In the New Testament, three key Greek words are used<a href="https://atlas.perseus.tufts.edu/dictionaries/entry/urn:cite2:scaife-viewer:dictionary-entries.atlas_v1:cambridge-greek-lexicon-10986/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/resources/lexical/index.cfm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[8]</a>:
* Hades refers to the intermediate state of the dead<a href="https://sermons.logos.com/sermons/231488-where-do-the-spirits-of-believers-go-after-death" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[9]</a>.
* Tartarus (mentioned once in 2 Peter 2:4) is where fallen angels are imprisoned<a href="https://www.esv.org/verses/2+Peter+2:4/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[10]</a>.
* Gehenna is the most significant, drawing its name from the Valley of Hinnom, a real-life garbage dump outside Jerusalem where refuse was burned. It is this term that Jesus uses most often to describe the final place of eternal judgment<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/what-does-gehenna-mean-in-the-bible.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a>.

As the ultimate authority on this subject, Jesus provides several descriptions<a href="https://www.moody.edu/academics/programs/online-grad-cert-biblical-studies/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[12]</a>:

1.  A place of "outer darkness" where "there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+8:12&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 8:12</a>)<a href="https://www.openbible.info/topics/wailing_and_gnashing_of_teeth" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[13]</a>.
2.  A "fiery furnace" where law-breakers will be thrown at the end of the age: "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13:41-42&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 13:41–42</a>)<a href="https://www.dts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[14]</a><a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/should-not-perish" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[15]</a>.
3.  "The hell of fire" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:22&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 5:22</a>)<a href="https://biblehub.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[16]</a><a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[17]</a>.
4.  "Eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:41&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 25:41</a>)<a href="https://apologeticspress.org/who-believes-in-hell-anymore-1204/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[18]</a><a href="https://www.ligonier.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[19]</a>.
5.  Where "the fire never goes out" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9:43&version=NIV" target="_blank">Mark 9:43</a>)<a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/devotionals/unquenchable-fire-hell" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[20]</a><a href="https://www.gty.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[21]</a>.
6.  A place of "eternal punishment" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:46&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 25:46</a>)<a href="https://www.wts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[22]</a><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[23]</a>.


While these passages affirm the reality of fire and torment, the Bible also suggests that punishment is proportional to the severity of the sin<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[24]</a><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[25]</a>. The description of fire should not be the sole focus, as Jesus also describes it as "outer darkness," indicating that the imagery used is multifaceted<a href="https://digitalbible.ca/article-page/modern-topics-what-does-the-bible-say-about-hell" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[26]</a><a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/hell-as-endless-punishment/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[27]</a>.

The most profound understanding of hell is that it is a state of being completely separate from God, who is the source of all life, goodness, and joy<a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/hell-as-endless-punishment/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[28]</a><a href="https://www.crossway.org/articles/the-greatest-danger-that-any-human-being-faces/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[29]</a>. In essence, hell is the absence of God's beatific presence<a href="https://wm.wts.edu/read/the-promise-is-for-you-and-your-children" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[30]</a><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/heaven-would-be-hell-without-god" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[31]</a>.

This leads to the question of why a loving God would send anyone there. The Protestant view emphasizes that God grants humanity free will to choose to walk with Him or to reject Him<a href="https://www.str.org/w/can-choosing-god-be-a-matter-of-free-will-if-hes-threatening-us-with-hell" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[32]</a><a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/reasonable-faith-podcast/wes-morriston-problem-of-evil-and-moral-argument-part-1" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[33]</a>. Because God is love, He honors this choice, allowing those who persistently reject His presence in life to continue in that chosen state of separation in the afterlife<a href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-qa/gods-unconditional-love/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[34]</a><a href="https://www.crossway.org/articles/how-could-a-loving-god-send-people-to-hell/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[35]</a>.

Hell is the ultimate consequence of sin, which is everything that is not of God<a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/shall-you-not-surely-die/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[36]</a>. Since God is goodness and love, sin is fundamentally the opposite of His nature and results in separation from Him<a href="https://www.epsociety.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[37]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/evil-log/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[38]</a>.

The Good News is that salvation does not depend on our own merit, being perfectly good, or any works we perform<a href="https://static.billygraham.org/sites/tiftarea.billygraham.org/uploads/prod/2020/06/Crusades-Steps-to-Peace.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[39]</a><a href="https://www.societyofchristianphilosophers.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[40]</a>. As Jesus stated, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3:16&version=NIV" target="_blank">John 3:16</a>)<a href="https://www.paulistpress.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[41]</a><a href="https://www.crossway.org/articles/saving-faith-receives-christ/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[42]</a>. By accepting Jesus into our hearts and believing in Him<a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[43]</a><a href="https://shop.gty.org/library/articles/A335/who-do-you-think-that-i-am" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[44]</a>, we receive forgiveness for all sin that separates us from God<a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/lord-was-him" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[45]</a><a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/transforming-love" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[46]</a>.
