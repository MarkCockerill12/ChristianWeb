It’s commonly stated that the Bible contains 66 books, which is true for the Protestant canon. However, the Catholic Bible includes additional texts, often referred to as the Deuterocanonical books, bringing the total to 73. These books include Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, and 1 and 2 Maccabees, among others.

One of the key reasons for the Protestant rejection of these books is that they were not part of the Hebrew Bible and were written during the intertestamental period (approximately 400 B.C. to 1st century B.C.). This means they were produced after the Old Testament prophetic era had closed, and in many cases, the authors are unknown or pseudonymous.

Additionally, several of the Deuterocanonical books contain teachings or historical details that appear to conflict with the rest of Scripture. For example:
	•	2 Maccabees 12:44-46 supports the idea of praying for the dead, which contradicts Hebrews 9:27, where it says, “It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment.”
	•	Tobit 12:9 claims that almsgiving “delivers from death and purges away every sin,” which seems inconsistent with the core biblical doctrine that only faith in Christ brings salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9).

Historically, these books were included in the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Old Testament used in the early church), but were not universally accepted as authoritative. During the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Reformers like Martin Luther challenged their canonical status, emphasizing adherence to the Hebrew Bible as the basis for the Old Testament canon.

In summary, while the Catholic Church includes these additional books, many Protestant scholars and traditions argue against their canonicity due to their late origin, lack of prophetic authority, unknown authorship, and theological inconsistencies with the rest of Scripture.
