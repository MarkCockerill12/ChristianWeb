Miracles explained- if I put £50 in a drawer one night, £50 in another night, and then the third night I find £10 left, the legal law has been broken, not the law of arithmetic. What we thought was a closed loop of cause and effect was not secure as imagined. If things didn’t have a set pattern, we wouldn’t be able to recognize miracles

Miracles dont break the laws of reality,
If someone steals money and you find you are left with less than you started, the legal law has been broken, not the laws of arithmetic. What we thought was a closed loop of cause and effect had someone who intervened. God designed the system to be consistent so that we can recognise miracles when they happen
 
Personal Experience: Car came and hit another car and flipped, no one hurt apart from driver who is semi-conscious, the driving side isn’t too bad. Its actually really lucky that is happened outside of our church when there was an event on, otherwise he might not have gotten help in time since it was a quiet road. Its also a miracle no one else was hit since there were tons of kids
