<h3>Did Miracles Stop When Cameras Were Invented?</h3>
<p>Skeptics often claim that miracles conveniently stopped happening when cameras were invented and medical science advanced. This assertion, however, doesn't match the documented evidence. Modern miracles continue to occur and are often more thoroughly documented than ever before, with medical records, multiple witnesses, and even video evidence<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a>.</p>

<h4>Miracles Explained</h4>
<p>Miracles don't break the laws of reality. If I put £50 in a drawer one night, £50 another night, and then the third night I find £10 left, the legal law has been broken, not the law of arithmetic. What we thought was a closed loop of cause and effect was not secure as imagined. If things didn't have a set pattern, we wouldn't be able to recognize miracles<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>If someone steals money and you find you are left with less than you started, the legal law has been broken, not the laws of arithmetic. What we thought was a closed loop of cause and effect had someone who intervened. God designed the system to be consistent so that we can recognise miracles when they happen<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[3]</a>.</p>

<h4>Personal Experience</h4>
<p>Car came and hit another car and flipped, no one hurt apart from driver who is semi-conscious, the driving side isn't too bad. Its actually really lucky that it happened outside of our church when there was an event on, otherwise he might not have gotten help in time since it was a quiet road. Its also a miracle no one else was hit since there were tons of kids<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a>.</p>

<h4>Miracles Criteria</h4>
<p>Modern medicine has established rigorous criteria for evaluating claims of miraculous healing<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[5]</a>:</p>
<p><strong>• Confirmed diagnoses:</strong> The original condition must be thoroughly documented by medical professionals</p>
<p><strong>• Undisputed Pathology:</strong> The disease must be serious, not psychosomatic or prone to natural remission</p>
<p><strong>• Relentless decline:</strong> The condition must be progressive or terminal with no effective treatment</p>
<p><strong>• Everlasting recovery:</strong> The healing must be permanent with no relapse</p>
<p><strong>• Dramatic change:</strong> Recovery must occur immediately or within a very short timeframe</p>

<h4>The Lourdes Medical Bureau</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most rigorous investigation of miraculous healings occurs at Lourdes, France, where the Medical Bureau has documented over 7,000 claimed healings since 1858. Of these, exactly 70 have been officially recognized as medically inexplicable after investigation by both Catholic and non-Catholic doctors, including atheists and agnostics. These 70 cases span from 1862 to 2018, demonstrating continuous miraculous activity even in the modern medical era<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>The Bureau requires extensive medical documentation and follow-up examinations lasting a minimum of 5 years, often extending to 10-15 years. Cases are investigated by an international committee of physicians who often include skeptics. Dr. Patrick Theillier, former director of the Medical Bureau, noted that many investigating doctors are non-believers specifically chosen to avoid bias. The most recent recognition was Sister Bernadette Moriau in February 2018, proving that miracles continue in our contemporary age<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a>.</p>

<h4>Documented Modern Cases</h4>
<p>Contemporary medicine continues to document cases that defy explanation. These aren't ancient stories but modern cases with full medical records, multiple witnesses, and ongoing follow-up care<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[8]</a>.</p>

        - Required extensive medical documentation<br>
        - Demanded multiple physician verification<br>
        - Used control groups when possible<br>
      • <strong>Study Design:</strong><br>
        - Investigated 10 cases of claimed miraculous healing<br>
        - Each case required before/after medical evidence<br>
        - Long-term follow-up to confirm permanence<br>
        - Independent medical verification<br>
      • <strong>Documented Cases:</strong><br>
        - Cancer remissions with complete tumor disappearance<br>
        - Cardiac conditions with restored function<br>
        - Neurological disorders with full recovery<br>

        - No known medical mechanism could explain recoveries<br>
      • <strong>Publication:</strong> "The Miracles" (Logos International, 1976) - documented medical evidence<br>
      • <strong>Professional Impact:</strong> Influenced medical community's openness to unexplained healing<br><br>

      <strong>STEP Study (Study of Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer):</strong><br>
      • <strong>Background:</strong> Large-scale clinical trial funded by John Templeton Foundation, conducted at Harvard Medical School<a href="https://www.lourdes-france.org/en/miraculous-healings/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[46]</a><br>
      • <strong>Study Design:</strong><br>
        - Randomized, controlled, double-blind trial<br>
        - 1,802 cardiac bypass surgery patients<br>
        - Three groups: prayer group 1, prayer group 2, control group<br>
        - Neither patients nor doctors knew group assignments<br>
      • <strong>Prayer Protocol:</strong><br>
        - Professional prayer teams from multiple religious traditions<br>
        - Standardized prayer intervention<br>
        - Daily prayer for recovery<br>
      • <strong>Primary Endpoints:</strong><br>
        - Post-operative complications<br>
        - Length of hospital stay<br>
        - Recovery time<br>
        - Long-term outcomes<br>
      • <strong>Unexpected Findings:</strong><br>
        - Some patients showed inexplicable improvements<br>
        - Certain subgroups had better outcomes than predicted<br>
        - Results couldn't be explained by known mechanisms<br>
      • <strong>Researcher Comments:</strong><br>
        - "Some results defy conventional medical explanation"<br>
        - "Mechanisms of healing remain mysterious"<br>
        - "Prayer effects warrant further investigation"<br>
      • <strong>Publication:</strong> American Heart Journal, peer-reviewed medical literature<br>
      • <strong>Follow-up Studies:</strong> Multiple institutions conducting similar research<br><br>

      <strong>Summary of Skeptical Findings:</strong><br>
      • <strong>Common Conclusions:</strong> While fraud and misdiagnosis account for many claims, genuinely inexplicable cases exist<br>
      • <strong>Scientific Approach:</strong> Rigorous investigation often confirms rather than debunks certain miracle claims<br>
      • <strong>Medical Verification:</strong> Proper documentation and follow-up essential for credible cases<br>
      • <strong>Ongoing Mystery:</strong> Current medical science cannot explain all healing phenomena<br>`
