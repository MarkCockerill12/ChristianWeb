Direct Claims and Statements
1. John 10:30
"I and the Father are one."
This was understood by the Jewish leaders as a claim to divinity, leading them to accuse Him of blasphemy.

2. John 8:58
"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."
• Jesus uses the phrase "I am," directly referencing God's name as revealed in Exodus
3:14 ("I AM WHO I AM"), which the Jews recognized as a claim to divinity.

3. John 14:9
"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father."
Jesus explains that seeing Him is equivalent to seeing God the Father.

4. Revelation 1:8
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
Though primarily referring to God, Jesus applies this title to Himself later in Revelation (22:13).
Indirect Claims and Actions

5. John 5:18
"This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he
379
God."
Jesus' claim of a unique relationship with God was understood as claiming equality with Him.



Jesus calls himself the son of man, from Daniel when talking about man made divine.


Sources are well known historically accurate. As stated too by sources outside the Bible; highly regarded roman Historian Tacitus(64AD wrote: “Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.” // or what about Flavius Josephus, another great Roman Judean Historian, he wrote: “At this time there was a wise man who was called Jesus. His conduct was good, and [he] was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly, he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.” // or perhaps Lucian of Samosata, a Greek satirist who wrote a mockery of Christians: “The Christians, you know, worship a man to this day,–the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account…. You see, these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal for all time, which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them; and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.”
 
Testimonium Flavianum(Roman), Josephus(Jew), Tacitus(Roman), Mara bar Sarapion(Syrian), Suetonius(Roman), The Talmud(Jewish documentation), to name a few sources outside the Bible. These ppl did not directly witness Jesus’s life the guys who lived with Jesus did, and those guys are well documented as well. These were all written too closely in time and from too many different ppl from outside the Bible to not credit this as legitimate documentation that confirms there was a man named Yeshua(Jesus) that claimed to be the son of God. You don’t have to believe he actually was, but to say he wasn’t a real person is just intellectually dishonest. If Jesus doesn’t count as history than tons of historical figures don’t count either cause most of it’s documented the same way.
