  <h3>The Logical Dilemma</h3>
  One of the most prominent objections to Christianity is the logical problem of evil. The argument, often attributed to Epicurus, goes as follows:
  <br><br>
  If God is all-powerful, He <i>could</i> stop evil. If God is all-loving, He <i>would</i> stop evil. Yet evil exists. Therefore, an all-powerful and all-loving God cannot exist<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/evil-log/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a>.
  <br><br>
  This seems logical on the surface, but it assumes two false premises: first, that an all-powerful God can do the logically impossible (like forcing someone to freely choose good), and second, that an all-loving God would have no higher purpose for allowing temporary suffering<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-natureof-god/the-problem-of-evil" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a>.
  <br><br>
  To understand this, we must first establish that "evil" is a moral judgment. Objective moral values—concepts of true "good" and "bad"—cannot exist without a moral lawgiver (God). Without God, evil is just a matter of opinion, not an objective fact<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-natureof-god/can-we-be-good-without-god" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[3]</a>.

  <h3>The Free Will Defense</h3>
  The Bible teaches that God created humanity with the capacity for genuine love, which requires free will. Love that is programmed or forced is not love at all.
  <br><br>
  <b>1. Created in God's Image:</b> "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-27&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 1:26-27</a>). Being made in His image implies moral agency—the ability to make meaningful choices<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/free-will.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a>.
  <br><br>
  <b>2. The Choice:</b> God provided a choice to Adam and Eve to ensure their love was voluntary. "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A16-17&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 2:16-17</a>).
  <br><br>
  <b>3. The Fall:</b> Humanity chose rebellion. "When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food... she took some and ate it" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A6&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 3:6</a>).
  <br><br>
  The philosopher Alvin Plantinga argues that it is logically impossible for God to create a world of free creatures who <i>always</i> choose good. If God forced us to choose good, we would not be free. Therefore, the potential for evil is the necessary cost of creating a world with free will and genuine love<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/evil-log/#H2" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[5]</a>. God values our freedom to choose Him: "Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+24%3A15&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Joshua 24:15</a>).

  <h3>Natural Evil and a Fallen World</h3>
  But what about earthquakes, cancer, and tsunamis? These are "natural evils" not directly caused by human choice. The Christian worldview explains this as the result of the Fall. When sin entered the world, it fractured not just human nature, but creation itself.
  <br><br>
  "Cursed is the ground because of you" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A17&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 3:17</a>). The Apostle Paul writes that "the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A22&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Romans 8:22</a>). We live in a broken world where the laws of nature, which sustain life, can also cause suffering<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/natural-moral-evil.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a>.
  <br><br>
  C.S. Lewis argued that for souls to interact, there must be a neutral "nature" with fixed laws (like gravity). These laws allow us to walk and build, but they also mean that if we fall, we get hurt. A world where the laws of nature constantly changed to prevent pain would be a world without consequences or meaningful action<a href="https://www.cslewisinstitute.org/resources/c-s-lewis-on-the-problem-of-pain/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a>.

  <h3>Purpose in Suffering (Soul-Making)</h3>
  Why doesn't God intervene more often? If God constantly prevented the consequences of our actions or the effects of nature, we would never mature. God is more interested in our holiness than our temporary happiness.
  <br><br>
  Suffering produces resilience and character. "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Romans 8:28</a>). This doesn't mean all things <i>are</i> good, but that God can <i>use</i> them for good.
  <br><br>
  The story of Joseph perfectly illustrates this. Sold into slavery by his brothers, he later saved them from famine, saying: "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+50%3A20&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 50:20</a>).
  <br><br>
  This is often called the "Soul-Making Theodicy"—the idea that this world is a "vale of soul-making" where we are refined. "For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+4%3A17&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>)<a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/devotionals/eternal-weight-of-glory" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[8]</a>.

  <h3>God Is With Us</h3>
  God is not a distant watchmaker. He entered into our suffering. Jesus Christ lived as a human, suffered betrayal, torture, and death. He prophesied this: "The Son of Man must suffer many things... and be killed" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8%3A31&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Mark 8:31</a>).
  <br><br>
  Because of Jesus, we have a God who sympathizes with us: "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A15&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Hebrews 4:15</a>). He offers comfort: "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+34%3A18&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Psalm 34:18</a>)<a href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com/get-help/where-is-god-in-the-midst-of-all-my-troubles/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[9]</a>.
  <br><br>
  Ultimately, Christianity offers a hope that secular worldviews cannot: the end of evil. "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A4&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Revelation 21:4</a>)<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/mhc/Rev/Rev_021.cfm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[10]</a>.
