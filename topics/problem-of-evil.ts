  content: `One of the most prominent objections to reality is a simple but good one. 
  If God is all porwerful, all-knowing, and all-good, why does evil and suffering exist<a href="https://www.christiananswers.net" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a><a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a>?
  The logic usually follows: If God is all-loving, then he cant be all-powerful, because he would stop evil. If he is all-powerful, then he can't be all-loving, because he allows evil to exist. Therefore the bible is wrong, and God doesn't exist<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[16]</a><a href="https://iep.utm.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[17]</a>. 
  And this does seem to be logical at first, until we read the first book of the bible.
  First of all, we need to actually judge the bible by the standard it sets as good as evil. Why? Because morality can't exist without God (more on that here)<a href="https://www.apologeticspress.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[3]</a><a href="https://www.str.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[5]</a>.

  Upon reading genesis we learn a few things<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a><a href="https://netbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[14]</a>

  1. We were made in God's image- "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-27&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 1:26-27</a>). This means we were given free will, and complete control over our actions<a href="https://www.dts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a><a href="https://www.wts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a>

  2. God put Adam and Eve in charge of the earth. (The animals and the land) - "God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground'" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A28&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 1:28</a>)

  3. God asked them not to eat from a specific tree. "And the Lord God commanded the man, 'You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die'" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A16-17&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 2:16-17</a>)

  4. We did it anyway. "When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A6&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 3:6</a>)

  5. Sin entered the world, and consequences followed. "To Adam he said, 'Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, "You must not eat from it," cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life'" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A17&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 3:17</a>), "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Romans 5:12</a>)<a href="https://www.sbts.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[8]</a><a href="https://www.ligonier.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[22]</a>

  After Adam and Eve first disobeyed God, sin entered the world. Sin itself is just a way to describe things that are not of God and thus not good<a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[21]</a><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[23]</a>.
  The world was perfect before this, but as we sinned the world became corrupted<a href="https://www.gty.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[24]</a><a href="https://www.crossway.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[25]</a>.
  Thats the set up out of the way, now we can use it to address the problems.

  "If God is all-powerful, why doesn't he just stop evil?": Because then we would cease to exist as we are, either as humans with free will or completely. God is indeed all-powerful - "For nothing will be impossible with God" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A37&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Luke 1:37</a>), "I know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+42%3A2&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Job 42:2</a>), but He values our freedom to choose: "Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+24%3A15&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Joshua 24:15</a>)<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a><a href="https://www.societyofchristianphilosophers.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[19]</a>.

  "If God is all-powerful, can't he just make it so that we have free will and dont do bad things?": Nope, if we cannot do something because God is limiting our choices, then it wouldn't be free will. True love and genuine relationship require the freedom to choose. As God said to Israel, "This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+30%3A19&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>). Even Jesus respected people's choice: "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23%3A37&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Matthew 23:37</a>)<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[16]</a><a href="https://www.epsociety.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[18]</a>.

  "If God is all-knowing, why would he make us if he knew we would sin?": The same reason a parent has a child, even though they know that child will make mistakes. God loves us, and wants us to be with him, but he also wants us to choose to be with him<a href="https://www.catholic.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[26]</a><a href="https://www.newadvent.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[27]</a>.

  Everything bad in the world is a result of sin, whether its from our choices now or the one that was made in eden<a href="https://www.fuller.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[10]</a><a href="https://www.tiu.edu/divinity" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[9]</a>

  So it's just a fact of the world that suffering is a part of our world and lives, so how do we deal with the fact that God just watches it happen?

  Well first of all, he doesn't. In fact he is with us in our suffering, and i don't just mean watching over you, i mean he sent down Jesus to live as a human for 33 years and face all the things we do, and he died in a very very painful way to put it mildly. As Isaiah prophesied: "Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53%3A4&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Isaiah 53:4</a>), and "He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53%3A3&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Isaiah 53:3</a>). Jesus understands our pain because "we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A15&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Hebrews 4:15</a>)<a href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[31]</a><a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[32]</a>. 
  
  This shows that God isn't distant, but close to us. "The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+34%3A18&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Psalm 34:18</a>), "Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23%3A4&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Psalm 23:4</a>), and "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A2&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Isaiah 43:2</a>)<a href="https://billygraham.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[33]</a><a href="https://www.ccef.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[34]</a>. 

  The Bible doesn't ignore suffering either, but it addresses it directly<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a><a href="https://biblehub.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[13]</a>:

  - **Job**: Explores suffering of the innocent - "Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+13%3A15&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Job 13:15</a>), "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A21&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Job 1:21</a>)<a href="https://www.oca.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[28]</a><a href="https://www.ancientfaith.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[29]</a>
  - **Ecclesiastes**: Acknowledges life's difficulties - "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A1&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>)<a href="https://www.esv.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[15]</a><a href="https://netbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[14]</a>
  - **Psalms**: Honest expressions of pain and doubt - "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+22%3A1&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Psalm 22:1</a>), "How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+13%3A1&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Psalm 13:1</a>)<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[12]</a><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a>
  - **Lamentations**: Mourning the destruction of Jerusalem - "Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations+3%3A22-23&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>)<a href="https://biblehub.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[13]</a><a href="https://www.etsjets.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[51]</a>

  And our suffering is not always in vain either, we are made to be resilient and learn from our mistakes or situation. In the bible, God uses the bad things that happens and turn them around to work in his favour. "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Romans 8:28</a>). After all, Judas betrayed Jesus, and God used that as part of his plan, just as Joseph said to his brothers who sold him into slavery: "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+50%3A20&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 50:20</a>)<a href="https://www.ligonier.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[22]</a><a href="https://www.desiringgod.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[23]</a>.

  God doesn't want us to suffer needlessly, he tells us not to worry, to come to him for support and more. "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A34&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Matthew 6:34</a>), "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A28&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Matthew 11:28</a>), and "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A7&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">1 Peter 5:7</a>)<a href="https://www.biblicalcounseling.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[35]</a><a href="https://www.churchofengland.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[30]</a>


  Sometimes our suffering helps us, sometimes its needed, but a lot of the time it just makes us sad. What is most important to remember is that God is with us no matter what we go through and he loves us. "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A38-39&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Romans 8:38-39</a>), and "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A4&version=ESV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Revelation 21:4</a>)<a href="https://www.focusonthefamily.com" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[31]</a><a href="https://billygraham.org" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[33]</a>.`,
