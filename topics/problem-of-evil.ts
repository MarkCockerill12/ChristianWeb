  One of the most prominent objections to reality is a simple but good one. 
  If God is all porwerful, all-knowing, and all-good, why does evil and suffering exist?
  The logic usually follows: If God is all-loving, then he cant be all-powerful, because he would stop evil. If he is all-powerful, then he can't be all-loving, because he allows evil to exist. Therefore the bible is wrong, and God doesn't exist. 
  And this does seem to be logical at first, until we read the first book of the bible.
  First of all, we need to actually judge the bible by the standard it sets as good as evil. Why? Because morality can't exist without God (more on that here).

  Upon reading genesis we learn a few things

  1. We were made in God's image- Genesis 1:26-27 "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them."(This means we were given free will, and complete control over our actions. More on that here)

  2. God put Adam and Eve in charge of the earth. (The animals and the land) Genesis 1:27-28 

  3. God asked them not to eat from a specific tree. Genesis 2:16-17 

  4. We did it anyway. Genesis 3:6-7

  5. Sin entered the world, and consequences slapped them in the face. Genesis 1:14-19

  After Adam and Eve first disobeyed God, sin entered the world. Sin itself is just a way to describe things that are not of God and thus not good.
  The world was perfect before this, but as we sinned the world became corrupted.
  Thats the set up out of the way, now we can use it to address the problems.

  "If God is all-powerful, why doesn't he just stop evil?": Because then we would cease to exist as we are, either as humans with free will or completely.

  "If God is all-powerful, can't he just make it so that we have free will and dont do bad things?": Nope, if we cannot do something because God is limiting our choices, then it wouldn't be free will.

  "If God is all-knowing, why would he make us if he knew we would sin?": The same reason a parent has a child, even though they know that child will make mistakes. God loves us, and wants us to be with him, but he also wants us to choose to be with him.

  Everything bad in the world is a result of sin, whether its from our choices now or the one that was made in eden

  So it's just a fact of the world that suffering is a part of our world and lives, so how do we deal with the fact that God just watches it happen?

  Well first of all, he doesn't. In fact he is with us in our suffering, and i don't just mean watching over you, i mean he sent down Jesus to live as a human for 33 years and face all the things we do, and he died in a very very painful way to put it mildly. 
  
  This shows that God isn't distant, but close to us. 

  The Bible doesn't ignore suffering either, but it addresses it directly:

  - **Job**: Explores suffering of the innocent
  - **Ecclesiastes**: Acknowledges life's difficulties
  - **Psalms**: Honest expressions of pain and doubt
  - **Lamentations**: Mourning the destruction of Jerusalem

  And our suffering is not always in vain either, we are made to be resilient and learn from our mistakes or situation. In the bible, God uses the bad things that happens and turn them around to work in his favour. After all, Judas betrayed Jesus, and God used that as part of his plan.

  God doesn't want us to suffer needlessly, he tells us not to worry, to come to him for support and more


  Sometimes our suffering helps us, sometimes its needed, but a lot of the time it just makes us sad. What is most important to remember is that God is with us no matter what we go thorugh and he loves us.
