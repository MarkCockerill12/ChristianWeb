But God said "kill this and that etc" They had been trying to eradicate and plunder Israel from the very birth of Israel, 200-400 years before the command in 1 Samuel 15, and they would continue for another 600 years. Amalekites seem to have been notorious for killing children when they attacked (1 Sam 15:33),
 
Israelites vs Canaanites, Two views:
Either Language "annihilate all of them" is hyperbolic as it precedes "do not inter-marry them"
Or, when God ends a life on earth, that isnâ€™t murder, he is the creator, he can create life. He has the authority. 

God commanding annihilation through Israel

1. God judges, this isn't culturally acceptable but is  a fact
2. Hyperbole was used, they didn't actually wipe them out because these people reappear in later books
3. Some places such as Jericho and Ai were actually smaller fortresses.
4. Individualism is far greater in our current culture than it was back then, consequences are generational, an example would be children of alcoholics. 
5. Innocent people are sometimes judged as part of a group of people, this would be horrible if death was the end, if they are innocent then they will go to heaven.
6. Other tribes did child sacrifices and other extreme evil.
7. Other nations were judged and destroyed, but this also happened to Israel when they turned away from God.
8. Enemies had to be destroyed with no prisoners (with some exceptions) so that Israel remained holy and separate from other nations 
9. If descendants were left alive, they would come back to fight you.
10. For that time period, killing the women and children was seen as far more merciful compared to what the alternatives were
