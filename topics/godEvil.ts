    <h3>The Question of God's Character</h3>
    <p>Critics often accuse God of being evil based on biblical accounts where He commands destruction or directly causes death. They point to the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Canaanite conquest, and individual judgments as evidence that the God of the Bible is immoral, violent, or evil.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> For broader questions about why evil exists in general, see our page on <a href="/categories/problem-of-evil" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: underline;">If God, Why Evil?</a> This page focuses specifically on whether God's actions make Him evil.</p>

    <h4>The Foundation for Moral Judgment</h4>
    <p>Before examining specific cases, we must establish the proper foundation for moral judgment. If God exists and is the source of moral law (Divine Command Theory), then His actions must be evaluated by His own perfect nature, not by fallen human standards corrupted by sin<a href="https://iep.utm.edu/divine-command-theory/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[1]</a>.</p>

    <h4>Key Principles for Understanding Divine Justice</h4>
    <p>When examining cases where God acts as judge, several biblical principles apply:</p>
    <p>• <strong>Creator's Authority:</strong> As the Creator of life, God has the absolute right to determine the length and circumstances of earthly existence<a href="https://denverjournal.denverseminary.edu/the-denver-journal-article/is-god-a-moral-monster-making-sense-of-the-old-testament-god/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[2]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Perfect Justice:</strong> God's judgments are always perfectly righteous, based on complete knowledge of human hearts and actions<a href="https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=three_one" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[3]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Mercy Within Judgment:</strong> Even in acts of judgment, God provides opportunities for repentance and shows mercy to the righteous<a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/patience-god" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[4]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Temporal vs. Eternal:</strong> Physical death is not the ultimate evil—separation from God for eternity (spiritual death) is far worse<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/physical-death.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[5]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Protection of the Innocent:</strong> In His perfect knowledge and nature as the Judge of all the earth, God ensures that innocent children who die go to His presence<a href="https://biblehub.com/topical/p/protection_of_the_innocent.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[6]</a></p>

    <h4>God's Character Revealed</h4>
    <p>Rather than showing God to be evil, these biblical accounts reveal His perfect character:</p>
    <p>• <strong>Perfect Holiness:</strong> "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty" - God cannot tolerate sin indefinitely (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+6:3&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Isaiah 6:3</a>)<a href="https://www.monergism.com/topics/attributes-god/holiness-god" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[7]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Perfect Justice:</strong> "The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+32:4&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>)<a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[8]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Perfect Love:</strong> "God is love" - His judgments flow from love for righteousness and the innocent (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:8&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">1 John 4:8</a>)<a href="https://learn.ligonier.org/podcasts/ultimately-with-rc-sproul/god-is-love" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[9]</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Long-suffering Patience:</strong> "The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3:9&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">2 Peter 3:9</a>) - God's delay is an act of mercy<a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/2_peter/3-9.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[10]</a></p>

    <h4>The Ultimate Demonstration</h4>
    <p>The greatest proof that God is not evil is found in the cross. Rather than destroying humanity for sin, God sent His Son to bear the judgment we deserved: "But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5:8&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Romans 5:8</a>). The cross is the ultimate intersection where God's perfect justice and boundless love meet<a href="https://thecallednation.net/the-cross-where-love-and-justice-meet/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[11]</a>. The same God who judges sin also provides salvation from that judgment<a href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-problem-of-evil/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[12]</a>.</p>

      <strong>Context and Justification:</strong><br>
      • <strong>Universal corruption:</strong> The judgment was necessary because "The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6:5&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 6:5</a>)<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Noah-Flood.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[14]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Violence and lawlessness:</strong> The earth was completely corrupted not only religiously but socially, being "filled with violence" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6:11&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 6:11</a>)<a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/6-11.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[15]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>120-year warning period:</strong> God patiently gave humanity 120 years to repent while Noah built the ark and preached righteousness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2:5&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">2 Peter 2:5</a>), showing reluctance to judge<a href="https://knowingscripture.com/articles/why-do-human-lifespans-not-reach-120-years-genesis-63" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[16]</a>.<br>

      <strong>Context and Justification:</strong><br>
      • <strong>Extreme wickedness:</strong> The city's sin included attempted gang rape of angels, but their deeper wickedness was defined as pride, gluttony, laziness, and a failure to help the poor and needy (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+16:49&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Ezekiel 16:49</a>)<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/EZK.16.49-50,56" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[20]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Abraham's intercession:</strong> God demonstrated His justice by proving His willingness to spare the cities for even ten righteous people, showing the judgment was a last resort due to total corruption (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+18:22-33&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 18:22-33</a>)<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Abraham-Sodom-Gomorrah.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[21]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Warning and escape:</strong> Lot and his family were warned and physically removed by angels before judgment fell (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19:12-16&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 19:12-16</a>)<a href="https://www.ucb.co.uk/word-for-today/145456" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[22]</a>.<br>

      • <strong>Judgment on false gods:</strong> Each plague targeted specific Egyptian deities (e.g., the Nile god Hapi, the frog goddess Heqet), proving their powerlessness and demonstrating Yahweh’s supremacy to both Egyptians and Israelites<a href="https://www.ucg.org/learn/beyond-today-magazine/beyond-today-magazine-march-april-2019/exodus-plagues-judgment-egypts-gods" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[27]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Protection available:</strong> Israelites and believing Egyptians who applied the Passover blood were protected (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12:13&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Exodus 12:13</a>), making the judgment conditional based on faith<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Passover-lamb.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[28]</a>.<br>

      <strong>Context and Justification:</strong><br>
      • <strong>400 years of patience:</strong> God waited 400 years (from Abraham to Moses) for Canaanite repentance before their judgment was carried out, showing profound forbearance (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15:16&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Genesis 15:16</a>)<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/archaeology/ancient-egypt/from-the-promise-to-the-exodus/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[32]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Extreme abominations:</strong> The judgment was delivered due to rampant, entrenched wickedness, specifically cited as child sacrifice, temple prostitution, and bestiality (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18:21-30&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Leviticus 18:21-30</a>)<a href="https://www.asor.org/anetoday/2017/12/child-sacrifice-ancient-israel" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[33]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Hyperbolic language:</strong> The command to "destroy completely" (<em>herem</em>) is understood in ancient Near Eastern military context as rhetorical language signifying a decisive, complete victory and removal, rather than literal biological genocide<a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/god-genocide/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[34]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Archaeological Context:</strong> Archaeological evidence suggests key cities like Jericho were small, heavily fortified garrisons at the time, not vast, highly populated metropolitan centers, limiting the scope of destruction to military targets<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/walls-of-Jericho" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[35]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Survivors evidence:</strong> The repeated reappearance of Canaanites throughout the book of Judges and later history confirms the conquest was territorial and political, not total ethnic extermination<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/genocide-in-ancient-israelite-and-early-jewish-sources/5317C0634BA3EB0EFBE4D597B1C4EE94" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[36]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Examples of mercy:</strong> Rahab, a Canaanite woman, and her family were spared and integrated into Israel due to her faith, demonstrating that repentance allowed for salvation regardless of ethnic origin (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6:25&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Joshua 6:25</a>)<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/life-Rahab.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[37]</a>.<br><br>
      
      <strong>Treatment of Captives and Women:</strong><br>
      • <strong>Law of the Captive Wife:</strong> In non-<em>herem</em> wars, the Law explicitly allowed taking non-Canaanite women as wives, but required a mandatory month-long waiting period for mourning, ritual cleansing (shaving head, paring nails), and the removal of her captive clothes before marriage. This process legally protected the woman from immediate sexual exploitation and forced the man to treat her as a wife, not a mere sex object (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+20:14&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Deuteronomy 20:14</a>)<a href="https://www.thetorah.com/article/the-captive-woman-at-the-intersection-of-war-and-family-laws" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[38]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Jesus's Moral Standard:</strong> This regulation should be viewed in light of Jesus's moral teaching, which condemned the internal sin of lust itself, stating that to look at a woman with lustful intent is already adultery in the heart (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:28&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Matthew 5:28</a>).

      • <strong>Proportional judgment:</strong> King Agag was singled out by Samuel for his cruelty, being judged because his "sword has made women childless" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15:33&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">1 Samuel 15:33</a>), showing the judgment was a just retribution for their wickedness<a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_samuel/15-33.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[44]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Future consequences:</strong> Saul's failure to completely execute the judgment led to the rise of Haman the Agagite, who later attempted to carry out a true genocide against the Jewish people in the book of Esther (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Esther+3:1&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Esther 3:1</a>)<a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/1-samuel-15-3.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[45]</a>.`

      • <strong>Clear violation:</strong> Uzzah touched the Ark, an explicit violation of Mosaic Law, which mandated that only Kohathites could handle it, and then only by poles, never by hand (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+4:15&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Numbers 4:15</a>)<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Uzzah.html" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[47]</a>.<br>
      • <strong>Irreverence toward holiness:</strong> The use of an oxcart (a non-Israelite method) to transport the Ark demonstrated a casual approach and lack of respect for God's sacred dwelling place, necessitating a severe public example<a href="https://www.crossway.org/articles/why-was-a-man-killed-for-touching-the-ark-of-the-covenant-2-samuel-6/" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[48]</a>.<br><br>

      • <strong>Social injustice:</strong> The prophets condemned the oppression of the poor and vulnerable while the wealthy maintained religious rituals, emphasizing that justice was a core part of the covenant (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+5:21-24&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Amos 5:21-24</a>)<a href="https://biblehub.com/study/amos/5-11.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[65]</a>.<br>

      <strong>Babylonian Captivity (586 BC):</strong><br>
      • <strong>Extreme patience:</strong> God waited patiently, sending prophet after prophet for at least 23 years (Jeremiah’s ministry) before the final judgment was decreed, demonstrating long-suffering love (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+25&version=NIV" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none;">Jeremiah 25</a>)<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2025&version=NRSVUE" target="_blank" style="color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: super;">[67]</a>.<br>
